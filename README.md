🌍 Welcome to my GitHub playground, where code meets creativity and coffee meets coding errors. ☕️

## About Me

🤖 Tech Enthusiast | 🚀 Firmware Developer | 💡 Problem Solver

I'm that engineer who can make hardware and software talk, and even throw a joke or two into the mix. My journey has led me through the realms of solid-state drives (SSDs), SoC platforms, and even the wild world of LabView. 

## My Adventures

🧙‍♂️ **Qualcomm's Coding Quest**: Unraveling the mysteries of Zephyr RTOS, as I tamed the dragon of power-hungry CPUs with a bit of magical firmware.

🚗 **Intel's Speedy SSD Safari**: I led a band of fearless developers, journeying through the tangled forests of code to deliver the fastest NVMe SSD known to humans. There were compiler gnomes and FPGA unicorns on the way.

🤖 **GSM and WCDMA Quest**: In a past life, I was a roaming warrior in the land of Ericsson, battling GSM demons and bringing mobile networks to life.

## Skill Set

- 👾 Languages: Python, C/C++, ARM Assembly, CMake, Shell Scripting
- 🔧 Developer Tools: Lecroy Bus Analyzer, Green Hill debugger (GHS), Trace32, Git, JIRA, Agile, Docker
- 🕸 Protocols: SPI, NVMe, PCIe, UART, I2C
- 🖥 Operating Systems: Zephyr, Bare Metal OS, RTOS

## Fun Fact

In a world where code is king, I'm the knight with a debugging sword, the wizard of weird bugs, and the bard of binary ballads. Just remember, behind every elegant solution is a trail of coffee mugs.
